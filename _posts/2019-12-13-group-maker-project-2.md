  Looking back on this project vs. Group Maker Project 1#, you would notice that
  the Home Ami boxes are quite different. For our social issue, we chose to
  address homelessness with the first Home Ami box. That, being the first box,
  we thought of the issue in part 1# of the project. Looking at the first box,
  it had camping equipment for living and was slightly larger than a typical gym
  bag. However, in the presentation it was deemed too large to be accessible and
  not very practical. Furthermore, now that I suspect it could have been too
  heavy to push or pull. 


  The final product you see above is smaller than in the first part, and I liked
  this one better too (except for the paint job being a single colour). In this
  box, we still addressed accessibility, but changed from emphasizing safety and
  longevity, to practicality and ergonomics instead. It was a lot more
  realistic, as I could see this possibly being produced in the future over the
  first box.

Above is the final product for my group: _Home Ami 2._ In the second part of the Group Maker Project, we could modify our existing box or create a new one. If we choose to recreate our box, then it should be made using environmentally sustainable materials. In addition to changing our box, we also had to pick a social issue for our box. Then we explained the way(s) our box addressed that issue.
