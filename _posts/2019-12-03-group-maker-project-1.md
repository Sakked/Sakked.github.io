  From my angle, the box turned out better than I was expectng. If only I was
  more prepared for the presentation and had wheels on the top and an additional
  handle on the bottom our box would be a lot better.

In this piece of work, we work in groups. The objective in the project is to create a box that can be used for a variety of different purposes. The purpose of the box, as well as the theme of the box, is left for us to decide. However, the box must be made from environmentally sustainable materials.
