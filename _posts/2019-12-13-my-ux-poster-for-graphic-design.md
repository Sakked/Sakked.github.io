  I have completed the poster, and overall looked decent. It was colourful, but
  wasn't as detailed as it could be. The one thing that could have made the
  poster looked nicer was to add shadows and gradients to the various tools that
  made up 'UX'. Unfortunately, at this time I currently do not have time to take
  a picture or screenshot of the project. But I will eventually!

As I said in the second post, in this assignment we had to create a User Experience Design Program poster. It was to attract future potential students into joining the program. This was the final assignment of the Graphic Design Course.
